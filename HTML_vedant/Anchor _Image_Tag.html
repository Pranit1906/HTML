Image Tag
●        <img> tag is used for displaying images in your web pages.

●        <img> tag has src attribute where we define the path of images.

●        We can give relative/absolute path

●        <img> is an empty tag hence it self closes itself.



Syntax:

<img  src="path/to/image"  alt="alternate text" />

Alternate text is not a compulsory attribute but using it helps in SEO as well as displaying text if image could not load.
